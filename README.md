# Quick Start to Stochastic Network Calculus

In this short tutorial, we show how to obtain delay bounds in the stochastic network calculus (SNC) with moment-generating functions (MGF).
arrivals and service are assumed to be $(\sigma, \rho)$-bounded, as it allows for closed-form solutions of all operators and performance bounds.
